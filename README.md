# My Reading Journal

### Introduction:

> Hi, my name is Jacob Jerde and I am becoming a software developer who wants to specialize in Java.

### Growth Mindset:

I believe a **growth mindset** is:

- Not letting your ability to learn be determined by your intelligence or talent
- Seeing failure as the beginning and not the end
- Anything can be learned with grit and hardwork

Learning difficult subject matter can be overwhelming and that can lead to feeling discouraged. In order to avoid this, I will remind myself of three things to keep me in check:

1. ***It's ok to struggle***
2. ***Everyone makes mistakes, and I can learn from each mistake***
3. ***Like Dory says: "Just keep swimming"***
