### What is Markdown?
Markdown uses simple syntax to format your text to add different design features (i.e. heading size, bold, block quotes, etc.)

### Headings:
In order to make a heading bigger or smaller, you need to add the # symbol and a space between the symbol and your heading. The less # symbols you write, the larger the heading will be. Conversely the more # symbols you add consecutively in front of your heading, the smaller it will be. The largest heading has one # and the smallest heading has ######. 

### Bold:
Bolding text is fairly simple. In order to **bold** your text you need to add two * symbols in front of and after the word(s) you are **bolding**.

### Block quotes:
> Block quotes just require one > symbol in front of a line with a space after it. 
> 
> To add more block quotes, drop down to the line below your first paragraph and add another > symbol and leave the rest of the line blank. Then drop down one more line, add another > symbol with a space and write your second paragraph. 

### Lists:
**Numbered Lists** can be written by starting the empty line and writing 1. (fill in text) and then hit enter. Drop down to the next line and write 2. (fill in text). Continue these steps with sequential numbers for as many items in your list as needed. 
1. Item One
2. Item Two
3. Item Three

**Unordered Lists** can be written by starting with an empty line and using the - symbol to start the list. For each new item use the - symbol to continue the list. 
- Item One
- Item Two
- Item Three

### Images:
To add an image, use the ! symbol followed by [] around the alt text image address and then wrap the image link address with () or drag and drop the image into an empty line.
